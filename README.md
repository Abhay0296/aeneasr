Hi there, welcome to my MySpace...I mean GitHub profile page!

I author and maintain popular open source projects which are primarily written in Go or React. I care deeply about education, climate change, data privacy and ownership which is why I have

- co-founded Serlo Education e.V., a German non-profit NGO which operate the open education platform www.serlo.org and brings educational resources (math, physics, chemistry, German, ...) without advertising and free of charge to millions of users per month;
- founded the [ORY open source organization](https://github.com/ory) which provides popular developer tools in the area of user management, access control, policy management, and cloud technology.

Currently I work full-time at ORY where my responsibility is writing the ORY software stack.

## Projects

These are projects I started and either still maintain or maintained for a significant amount of time.
