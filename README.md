Hi there, welcome to my MySpace...I mean GitHub profile page!

I author and maintain popular open source projects which are primarily written in Go or React. I care deeply about education, climate change, data privacy and ownership which is why I have

- co-founded Serlo Education e.V. in 2009/2010, a German non-profit NGO which operates the open education platform www.serlo.org and brings educational resources (math, physics, chemistry, German, ...) without advertising and free of charge to millions of users per month. German President Frank Walter-Steinmeier awarded us with Germany's Federal Cross of Merit in 2019 for our work at Serlo;
- founded the [ORY open source organization](https://github.com/ory) in 2016 which provides popular developer tools in the area of user/identity management, access control, policy management, user privacy, delegation and federation, cloud automation, and cloud security.

Currently I work full-time at ORY where my responsibility is primarily writing the ORY software stack. I also enjoy landscape photography which you can find at [__aeneas](https://www.instagram.com/__aeneas/). You may also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aeneasr/) from time to time.

There are many other projects I contribute to which are displayed in my public commit history.

## Research

My master thesis in computer science [*Distributed linear correlation cluster detection using MapReduce*](./rek18-lmu.pdf) applies mathematic projections and computer graphic algorithms to high-volume and high-dimensional data in order to find meaningful patterns in reasonable time. Because I decided against pursuing a PhD it is my only public research paper to date.Writing code is more enjoyable than writing than text to me ;)
