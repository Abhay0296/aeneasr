Hi there!

I author and maintain popular open source projects which are primarily written in Go or React. I care deeply about education, climate change, data privacy and ownership which is why I have founded/co-founded

- Serlo Education e.V., a German non-profit NGO which operate the open education platform www.serlo.org and brings educational resources (math, physics, chemistry, German, ...) without advertising and free of charge to millions of users per month;
- ORY Foundation GmbH which runs the open source [github.com/ory](https://github.com/ory) organization;
- ORY Corp which commercializes the open source ORY stack.



## Projects

These are projects I started and either still maintain or maintained for a significant amount of time.
